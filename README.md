I created this page for three reasons:

- I was tired of how many steps I have to take to display a simple
  markdown document. Asciidoc is even worse: it is quite a procedure
  to install code that converts Asciidoc to HTML.
- This was also an experiment to see if I can create a converter that
  runs in a web page, without running a server of my own. This whole
  page is run as GitHub Pages.
- All Markdown converters that I was able to find online have
  annoying advertising that I had to suffer even if I want to do such
  a simple things as displaying a Markdown.
